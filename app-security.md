# Layer-by-Layer Breakdown

## Perimeter Security Controls
* Web Application Firewall (WAF)
    * Monitors HTTP requests to block known attack vectors (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
* Firewall & Network ACLs
    * Restricts inbound/outbound traffic to approved ports, protocols, and IPs.
* Intrusion Detection/Prevention (IDS/IPS)
    * Detects or blocks malicious patterns and suspicious traffic at the network level.

## Security Operations & Monitoring
* Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
** Aggregates and correlates logs from across the environment for real-time analysis.
* Security Operations Center (SOC)
** Monitors alerts, investigates anomalies, and coordinates incident response.
* Threat Intelligence / Anomaly Detection
** Identifies potential threats by analyzing indicators of compromise and behavioral anomalies.

## Application Delivery Layer
* API Gateway
** Central point for API traffic, handling authentication, rate limiting, and policy enforcement.
* Load Balancer
** Distributes traffic across multiple servers or containers to improve availability.
* Content Delivery Network (CDN)
** Caches content at geographically distributed edge servers to reduce latency and add a layer of DDoS defense.
* Reverse Proxy
** Can terminate SSL/TLS and route internal requests, often adding caching or rewriting capabilities.

## Identity & Access Management (IAM) Layer
* Authentication
** Verifies user or service identity using credentials and (optionally) MFA.
* Authorization
** Ensures each authenticated entity has the minimum privileges required (RBAC/ABAC).
* Single Sign-On (SSO)
** Centralized login experience across multiple applications or services.
* OAuth / OpenID Connect
** Allows secure, delegated authorization and federated identity.
* Session Management
** Manages session tokens securely (e.g., rotation, expiration, invalidation).

## Application Services & Business Logic
* Secure Coding Practices
** Follow guidelines to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
** Employ thorough dependency scanning to eliminate known issues in third-party libraries.
* Input Validation & Output Encoding
** Protects against XSS, injection, and other attacks by sanitizing data at boundaries.
* Business Logic Security
** Ensures critical functions (e.g., financial transactions) have robust authorization, proper checks, and auditing.
* Logging & Monitoring
** Captures relevant application events and errors.
** Integrates with SIEM for centralized analysis.
* Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)
** Monitors application behavior in real-time.
** Helps detect and block certain attacks by analyzing how the application processes requests.

## Data Management & Persistence
* Databases & Data Stores
** Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS).
** Enforce strong authentication and least-privilege access.
* Secrets Management
** Centralizes and secures API keys, credentials, and certificates (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider secrets).
* Database Activity Monitoring (DAM)
** Tracks queries to detect unusual behaviors, unauthorized changes, or potential data exfiltration.


## Infrastructure Layer
* Host Security
** Keep operating systems patched and hardened.
** Minimize attack surface by disabling unnecessary services.
* Virtual Machines / Containers
** Use minimal, secure base images and continuously scan for vulnerabilities.
** Limit container privileges and isolate container workloads via proper configurations.
* Network Segmentation & Zero Trust
** Restrict and isolate traffic between different tiers (web, app, database).
** Authenticate and authorize all traffic, including internal requests.
* Kubernetes & Orchestrators (if applicable)
** Protect the control plane (K8s API), enable RBAC, and use admission controllers to ensure secure deployments.

## DevSecOps / CI/CD Pipeline
* Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
** Automatically scan source code for insecure patterns.
* Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
** Tests live applications for exploitable vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.).
* Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
** Identifies outdated or risky open-source components in your codebase.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scanning
** Checks Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes YAML files for misconfigurations.
* Automated Security Testing
** Integrates SAST, DAST, and SCA into the build pipeline to detect issues early and block insecure builds.
* Secure Build & Deploy
** Enforces signed images, verifies artifact integrity, and secures the deployment environment.

# Cross-Cutting Considerations
* Logging & Auditing
** Centralize logs from all layers (WAF, RASP, app, infrastructure).
** Use tamper-evident storage for forensic analysis.
* Threat Modeling
** Regularly identify high-value assets, likely threat actors, and potential vulnerabilities.
* Incident Response & Forensics
** Maintain a well-documented process for detection, containment, and recovery.
** Practice tabletop exercises to validate readiness.
* Compliance & Governance
** Align security controls with relevant standards (e.g., PCI DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR).
** Maintain documentation and evidence for audits.
* Security Training & Awareness
** Conduct regular training for developers and operations teams on secure coding, threat modeling, and handling incidents.
** Promote a culture of shared security responsibility.


# Key Takeaways
* Defense in Depth
** Layer multiple security controls so no single failure leads to compromise.
* Least Privilege
** Restrict each service or user to the minimal access they need.
* Shift Left
** Integrate and automate security tests early in development to find vulnerabilities sooner.
* Zero Trust Principles
** Continuously authenticate and authorize every request, inside or outside the network perimeter.
* Runtime Visibility
** Include mechanisms like RASP to add a real-time layer of application-awareness, but remember itâ€™s just one part of a comprehensive
